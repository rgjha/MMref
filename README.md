In the longer version, I had planned to discuss method of orthogonal polynomials used often by Mehta et al. in the 1980s 
to solve various models. Also, a disucssion of Kontsevich model (related to description of decomposition of moduli space of Riemann
surfaces) was attempted but left out due to time constraints. Some other notable things left were Weyl's character formula which 
is often used in matrix models and the non-singlet sector of matrix quantum mechanics.
